# Ongi - Your Daily AI-Powered Photo Journal

Ongi is a mobile-first web application built with Next.js that transforms your daily photos into meaningful journal entries. Each day, you upload a single photo, and our AI generates a unique, thought-provoking question about it. Your answer, combined with the photo and the question, creates a beautiful, reflective record for that day.

};

export default firebaseConfig;
```

You will also need to set up a `.env.local` file for any server-side environment variables, particularly for Firebase Admin SDK initialization.
